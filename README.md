## 🧠 What I Build

I work at the intersection of **AI research and production engineering**, with a focus on systems that must:

- Handle noisy, imperfect real-world inputs  
- Produce **deterministic, explainable outputs**  
- Be evaluated, measured, and stress-tested — not just generated  

My work emphasizes **architecture, evaluation, and failure modes** over surface-level demos.

## 🚀 Flagship Systems (v1.0 – Stable)

### **SamvidAI** — Enterprise Document Intelligence
- Layout-aware OpticalRAG system for legal & procurement documents  
- OCR → layout parsing → retrieval → LLM reasoning → deterministic risk scoring  
- Designed for noisy PDFs, ambiguous clauses, and explainable outputs  
- Includes tests, failure handling, metrics, and end-to-end execution artifacts  

**Focus:** document understanding, evaluation under noise, system reliability

---

### **IntervuxAI** — Interview Evaluation System
- Agent-based interview simulation and evaluation pipeline  
- Generates structured, rubric-driven feedback (clarity, confidence, correctness)  
- Emphasizes evaluation logic, scoring consistency, and failure analysis  
- Produces machine-readable reports from live or scripted inputs  

**Focus:** human evaluation, subjective signal modeling, scoring systems

---

## ⚙️ Applied & Performance Systems

### **TraffyxAI**
- Real-time traffic intelligence pipeline  
- Detection → tracking → violation logic with latency, FPS, and memory profiling  
- Built with performance constraints and system metrics as first-class concerns  

**Focus:** edge vision, performance engineering, real-time systems

---

## 🧪 Research Directions (Exploratory)

- **Pragya-OS:** Exploration of agent-native operating systems for long-horizon planning, memory, and reflection  
- **Animark-AI:** Experimental multimodal generation pipelines for visual storytelling and advertising  

*(Research explorations — not positioned as finished products)*

---

## 📊 Execution Evidence (No Demo Videos)

Instead of videos, my projects emphasize **reproducible proof**:

- End-to-end input → output examples  
- Deterministic JSON / report outputs  
- Latency and pipeline metrics  
- Explicit failure cases and trade-off documentation  

These artifacts are available inside each repository under `/examples`, `/docs`, and `/assets`.

## ✍️ Writing & Knowledge Sharing

I write about deep learning fundamentals, optimization, and applied AI:

- CNNs and modern computer vision  
- Optimizers, normalization, and training dynamics  
- Practical trade-offs in real-world ML systems  

📖 Articles published on *Artificial Intelligence in Plain English* and *Python’s Gurus*.
